<strong>Welcome to React Yahtzee! </strong>

Current Release: v1.0 

Version 1.0 is the first fully functional release of the game.  This means that the game is fully playable according to the rules of Yahtzee.  When you complete a game, the app will total your scores for you.  There is currently no way to start a new game other than reloading the app.

If you would like to run the game locally, you will need node package manager (npm). To run it locally, fork the repository, navigate to the directory containing the project and run
```
npm install
```

Then run
```
npm start
```
Open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to play the game!

Responses, feedback, and contributions related to React Yahtzee are welcomed. Future releases will include improved user interface and a database of high scores. For a related project, please see my Yahtzee Probability Calculator (written in Ruby), also on GitHub. Happy rolling!
