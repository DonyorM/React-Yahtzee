## <strong>Welcome to React Yahtzee! </strong>

### Current Release: v1.1

### <strong> What's new in 1.1 </strong>

- Modals now exist to help the user.  If a user clicks on the score table before they have completed all their rolls for the turn, or if the cell they click will score a zero and there are other cells that could register a non-zero score, a modal will pop up to advise them.
- Game Restart now exists. When a game ends the roll button will switch to a 'new game' button. Clicking it will reset the scorecard and dice to a starting position.
- A few styling changes were applied to make the game look and feel a lil nicer :)
