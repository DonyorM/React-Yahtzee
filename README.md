Welcome to React Yahtzee!
```
Current Release: v0.1.0

This game is still in development.  Version 0.1.0 is stable and has some of the game's basic functionality, but it is not possible to play a full game.  If you would like to run 0.1.0 locally, you will need node package manager (npm). 

To run the game locally, fork and clone the repository.  Navigate to the directory containing the project and run
```
npm install
```

Then run
```
npm start
```
Open a browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to play the game!

Responses, feedback, and contributions related to React Yahtzee are welcomed. I expect to have a fully functional release of the game in February or March of 2019.  For a related project, please see my Yahtzee Probability Calculator (written in Ruby), also on GitHub. Happy rolling!
